These consumers – \\nprimarily from tier-2, 3 and 4 cities – differ in digital literacy, infrastructure, social and cultural \\nfactors from the urban populace, who are accustomed to shopping online. \\nOnline shopping is not just a convenience but a lifeline for millions of consumers in India, \\nespecially in tier-2 and 3 cities, where the availability of the latest and popular products \\nin physical stores is limited. These consumers are the drivers of a retail revolution in the \\ncountry. In the festive season of 2023, consumers from tier-2, 3 and 4 cities contributed to \\nmore than 80% of sales for Meesho and Amazon 2 highlighting a major opportunity for brands \\nto tap into the growing aspirations and needs of consumers from these markets.  \\nOrganisations which serve our vast, diverse nation know how India changes every 100 \\nkilometres – not only in terms of language, dialect and culture but also in consumer \\nbehaviour (motivations, pain points and preferences). However, there is a lack of \\ncomprehensive and reliable data and insights on the online shopping behaviour of Indian \\nconsumers, and the challenges and opportunities across regions. This hinders the \\ndevelopment of effective customer-centric strategies and offerings. \\n1 https://www.ibef.org/industry/ecommerce-presentation\\n2 https://retail.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/e-commerce/e-tailing/non-metros-dominate-online-festival-sale-across-amazon-meesho-\\nflipkart/104329498', 'PwC | How India shops online: Consumer preferences in the metropolises and tier 1-4 cities\\n4 \\nHighly value-conscious, the average Indian consumer wants the best deals, loyalty \\nprogrammes, referral schemes and discounts which not only reward their purchases but \\nalso encourages them to further explore the online shopping experience. A customer-\\ncentric approach utilising data, technology and innovation is required to address the distinct \\nneeds and expectations of these customers at scale. Consumers are not only influenced \\nby online channels, but also by offline touchpoints such as word-of-mouth, influencers and \\ntheir favourite local store(s). To meet these expectations, it is essential to offer a seamless \\nexperience by integrating customer support across multiple channels, implementing loyalty \\nprogrammes and consistently improving the app using real-time inventory management, \\nin-store Wi-Fi, mobile apps, and training the employees. This approach allows businesses to \\nleverage the benefits of both online and offline channels, creating a cohesive and convenient \\nexperience for customers. \\nThis report is based on an online survey of 2,100 people, 100 qualitative interviews, and 400 \\nin-person interviews across India with leading experts and industry partners. The insights \\nderived from the report highlight the similarities and differences in the purchasing habits, \\nchoices and mindsets of online shoppers across the country. \\nThis report is based on an online survey of 2,100 people, 100 qualitative \\ninterviews, and 400 in-person interviews across India with leading experts and \\nindustry partners. The insights derived from the report highlight the similarities and \\ndifferences in the purchasing habits, choices and mindsets of online shoppers \\nacross the country. \\n50% of consumers in metros and tier-1 cities value quick delivery, while for 54% of \\nconsumers in tier-2, 3 and 4 cities, deals and offers take precedence.\\nWith increasing financial independence, women’s shopping behaviour shifted from \\nsocial to individualistic across geographies as per our survey. \\nFake reviews of health and wellness products deter over 42% of tier-2, 3 and 4 \\ncities’ shoppers from making purchases in this category. They also prefer buying \\nthese products online since there are concerns related to the authenticity of these \\nproducts in brick-and-mortar stores. \\nSome of the key findings include the following:', 'PwC | How India shops online: Consumer preferences in the metropolises and tier 1-4 cities\\n5 \\nThis report aims to understand the pulse of India’s diverse consumer base and provide \\ninsights into their behaviour.

It can also be a reference point and guide \\nfor businesses to make informed decisions and actions to tap into the dynamics of the \\necommerce landscape in the non-metro region.\\nWhile urban dwellers (metros and \\ntier-1 cities) have traditionally dominated \\nthe online shopping scene, the rest of \\nIndia, comprising tier-2, 3, and 4 cities, is \\nemerging as a formidable force. \\nTo unlock the hows and whys of this \\nshift, we conducted over 100 in-person \\nqualitative interviews, followed by a \\nsurvey of 2,600 people across India from \\nNovember 2023 to January 2024. \\nAbout this report\\n2,600 +\\nRespondents\\n35\\nCities50:50\\nMale to female\\nrespondents’ \\nratio\\nFigure 1: Sample coverage', 'PwC | How India shops online: Consumer preferences in the metropolises and tier 1-4 cities\\n7 \\nThe sample, comprising an equal number of male and female respondents, covered a range \\nof socio-economic backgrounds and age groups (Gen Z, early–millennials, late–millennials \\nand Generation X).

The absence of premium \\nbrands and the persistent push given to some \\nproducts by sales staff who often lack product \\nknowledge has further fuelled the migration of \\nthe consumers to online shopping platforms in \\nrest of India consumers. Frequent stockouts for \\nspecific brands has been an additional cause of \\nfrustration for consumers. \\nIn contrast, consumers from rest of India face \\nanother set of challenges, including limited \\naccess to a wide range of products and brands \\nin local stores. This often restricts their choices. \\nAdditionally, unavailability of attractive offers \\nand discounts and other incentives has pushed \\nprice-conscious consumers in rest of India to \\nexplore digital avenues.  \\n4 https://www.businesstoday.in/latest/corporate/story/indians-spent-87-billion-hours-on-shopping-apps-in-2022 report-366927-2023-01-20', 'PwC | How India shops online: Consumer preferences in the metropolises and tier 1-4 cities\\n10 \\nHowever, both segments share some common motivators for purchasing online. Planned \\npurchases with specific timelines are often satisfied online due to the wider range of price \\noptions and brands available. Let us delve into some of those nuances.  \\nMotivators for shopping online: The absence of physical stores for premium brands, \\nstockouts of certain products, and a lack of knowledgeable staff in offline stores are the \\nmain reasons why the rest of India consumers opt for online shopping. On the other hand, \\nthe lack of discounts and special offers in physical stores, along with large crowds in \\nmalls during weekends are some of the reasons why urban dwellers prefer to shop online. \\nBrowsing through online shopping platforms during free time also triggers online purchase in \\nboth urban dwellers and rest of India.  \\nRole of social media on trials: Social media has amplified the awareness and aspirations \\nand 62% of respondents tried products after seeing them (perhaps repeatedly) on Facebook \\nand Instagram. As the preferences of rest of India shifts from TV and radio to digital \\navenues, social media becomes the most preferred channel for encouraging trials of new \\nproducts.

This \\nsuggests that while there is growing acceptance of UPI payments due to its convenience, \\nspeed and security, there are still concerns regarding online platforms and payment methods \\nparticularly among rest of India.

Specifically, Gen Z and early millennial \\nwomen actively seek out emerging skincare and haircare brands across various \\ngeographical regions.
